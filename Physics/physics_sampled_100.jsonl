This is\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\Phi_{2}=\\\\int_{d}^{d+w} \\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{2}}{2 \\\\pi r}(\\\\ell d r)=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{2} \\\\ell}{2 \\\\pi} \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{d+w}{d}\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nThe mutual inductance is $M=\\\\frac{\\\\Phi_{2}}{I_{2}}=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} \\\\ell}{2 \\\\pi} \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{d+w}{d}\\\\right)$. In to maintain the same flux in the loop, the current will change to $I_{3}$ where\\n\\n$$\\nL I_{1}=M I_{2}+L I_{3}\\n$$\\n\\nor\\n\\n$$\\nI_{3}=I_{1}-\\\\frac{M}{L} I_{2}\\n$$\\n\\nNow, we compute the force between the rectangular loop and the long, current-carrying wire. The forces on the vertical sides cancel out because the current in the loop is in opposite directions on these sides. From the horizontal sides, we have the force is\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\nF=\\\\sum\\\\left(I_{3} \\\\vec{\\\\ell} \\\\times \\\\vec{B}\\\\right) & =I_{3} \\\\ell\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{2}}{2 \\\\pi d}-\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{2}}{2 \\\\pi(d+w)}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\n& =\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} \\\\ell w}{2 \\\\pi d(d+w)}\\\\left[I_{2}\\\\left(I_{1}-\\\\frac{M}{L} I_{2}\\\\right)\\\\right] .\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nThis quadratic in $I_{2}$ is maximized when $I_{2}=\\\\frac{L}{2 M} I_{1}$ in which case the force becomes\\n\\n$$\\nF=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} \\\\ell w}{2 \\\\pi d(d+w)} \\\\frac{L I_{1}^{2}}{4 M}=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} \\\\ell w I_{1}^{2}}{4 \\\\pi d(d+w)} \\\\frac{\\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{w}{r}\\\\right)}{\\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{d+w}{d}\\\\right)}\\n$$\\n\\nNote: If the size of the wires is considered when computing flux, a slightly different answer is obtained.

physics of the particle accelerator LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN is discussed. CERN is the world's largest particle physics laboratory. Its main goal is to get insight into the fundamental laws of nature. Two beams of particles are accelerated to high energies, guided around the accelerator ring by a strong magnetic field and then made to collide with each other. The protons are not spread uniformly around the circumference of the accelerator, but they are clustered in so-called bunches.

The magnetic field inside the tubes will remain constant due to the conservation of magnetic flux, but outside, the magnetic field will be changed. The magnetic field outside the straws is defined by the following condition: there is no circulation of $\\\\vec{B}$ (because there are no currents outside the straws); there are no sources of the field lines, other than the endpoints of the straws; each of the endpoints of the straws is a source of streamlines with a fixed magnetic flux $\\\\pm \\\\Phi$. These are exactly the same condition as those which define the electric field of four charges $\\\\pm Q$. We know that if the distance between charges is much larger than the geometrical size of a charge, the charges can be considered as point charges (the electric field near the charges remains almost constant, so that the respective contribution to the change of the overall electric field energy is negligible). Therefore we can conclude that the endpoints of the straws can be considered as magnetic point charges. In order to calculate the force between two magnetic charges (magnetic monopoles), we need to establish the correspondence between magnetic and electric quantities.\\n\\nFor two electric charges $Q$ separated by a distance $a$, the force is $F=\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_{0}} \\\\frac{Q^{2}}{a^{2}}$, and at the position of one charge, the electric field of the other charge has energy density $w=\\\\frac{1}{32 \\\\pi^{2} \\\\varepsilon_{0}} \\\\frac{Q^{2}}{a^{4}}$; hence we can write $F=8 \\\\pi w a^{2}$. This is a universal expression for the force (for the case when the field lines have the same shape as in the case of two opposite and equal by modulus electric charges) relying only on the energy density, and not related to the nature of the field; so we can apply it to the magnetic\\n\\n\\n\\nfield. Indeed, the force can be calculated as a derivative of the full field energy with respect to a virtual displacement of a field line source (electric or magnetic charge); if the energy densities of two fields are respectively equal at one point, they are equal everywhere, and so are equal the full field energies. As it follows from the Gauss law, for a point source of a fixed magnetic flux $\\\\Phi$ at a distance $a$, the induction $B=\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi} \\\\frac{\\\\Phi}{a^{2}}$. So, the energy density $w=\\\\frac{B^{2}}{2 \\\\mu_{0}}=\\\\frac{1}{32 \\\\pi^{2} \\\\mu_{0}} \\\\frac{\\\\Phi^{2}}{a^{4}}$, hence\\n\\n$$\\nF=\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\mu_{0}} \\\\frac{\\\\Phi^{2}}{a^{2}}\\n$$\\n\\nFor the two straws, we have four magnetic charges.

Now to account for the backboard bounce, we reflect the hoop over the backboard. The problem is now equivalent to making it into the hoop that is 4.15 meters away now. So now we need to find the smallest velocity to reach this point. One way to do it is to use the safety parabola, which makes it so minimal calculations are needed, so we present that method here. However, this problem is also readily solvable with only basic kinematics.\\nThe point that the ball must hit (4.15 meters in front and 1 meter above) lies on the safety parabola when it is thrown at minimum speed. Since the focus of the safety parabola is the point of launch,\\n\\n\\n\\nthe directrix is\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sqrt{1^{2}+4.15^{2}}=4.27 \\\\mathrm{~m}\\n$$\\n\\naway from the top of the hoop.
