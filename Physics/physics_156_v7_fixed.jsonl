The length of the container is $L$ and the depth of the water is $h$. Assume that the surface of the water to begin with makes a small angle with the horizontal.

The magnetic field inside the tubes will remain constant due to the conservation of magnetic flux, but outside, the magnetic field will be changed. The magnetic field outside the straws is defined by the following condition: there is no circulation of $\\\\vec{B}$ (because there are no currents outside the straws); there are no sources of the field lines, other than the endpoints of the straws; each of the endpoints of the straws is a source of streamlines with a fixed magnetic flux $\\\\pm \\\\Phi$. These are exactly the same condition as those which define the electric field of four charges $\\\\pm Q$. We know that if the distance between charges is much larger than the geometrical size of a charge, the charges can be considered as point charges (the electric field near the charges remains almost constant, so that the respective contribution to the change of the overall electric field energy is negligible). Therefore we can conclude that the endpoints of the straws can be considered as magnetic point charges. In order to calculate the force between two magnetic charges (magnetic monopoles), we need to establish the correspondence between magnetic and electric quantities.\\n\\nFor two electric charges $Q$ separated by a distance $a$, the force is $F=\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_{0}} \\\\frac{Q^{2}}{a^{2}}$, and at the position of one charge, the electric field of the other charge has energy density $w=\\\\frac{1}{32 \\\\pi^{2} \\\\varepsilon_{0}} \\\\frac{Q^{2}}{a^{4}}$; hence we can write $F=8 \\\\pi w a^{2}$.

Indeed, the force can be calculated as a derivative of the full field energy with respect to a virtual displacement of a field line source (electric or magnetic charge); if the energy densities of two fields are respectively equal at one point, they are equal everywhere, and so are equal the full field energies. As it follows from the Gauss law, for a point source of a fixed magnetic flux $\\\\Phi$ at a distance $a$, the induction $B=\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi} \\\\frac{\\\\Phi}{a^{2}}$.
