The five faces shown contain 1 centre white face from 1 small white cube, 12 edge white faces and 5 corner white faces.

The number of unit lengths successively between the points $(1,0),(0,2),(3,0),(0,4),(5,0)$, and so on, increases by 2 each time. Starting at 1 and adding consecutive odd numbers leads to the sequence of square numbers, and so the path will reach $(n, 0)$, where $n$ is an odd number, after $n^{2}$ seconds. So after 121 seconds it would reach $(11,0)$ and after 2 minutes $(10,0)$. Alternatively, when the computer path reaches a grid point, shade grey the unit square immediately below and to the left of that point. For example, the diagram shows the area shaded grey when the path has reached $(2,0)$. Since each unit added to the path also adds one unit to the grey shaded area, the path length and the grey shaded area have the same numerical value. For convenience, shade black the unit square below and to the left of $(0,0)$. After 2 minutes, or 120 seconds, the path length is 120 , so the grey shaded area is 120 , and the total shaded area is 121 .
